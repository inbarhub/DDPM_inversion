Our inversion can be used for text-based **editing of real images**, either by itself or in combination with other editing methods.
Due to the stochastic nature of our method, we can generate **diverse outputs**, a feature that is not naturally available with methods relying on the DDIM inversion.

In this repository we support editing using our inversion, prompt-to-prompt (p2p)+our inversion, ddim or [p2p](https://github.com/google/prompt-to-prompt) (with ddim inversion).<br>
**our inversion**: our ddpm inversion followed by generating an image conditioned on the target prompt. 

**prompt-to-prompt (p2p) + our inversion**: p2p method using our ddpm inversion. 

**ddim**: ddim inversion followed by generating an image conditioned on the target prompt.

**p2p**: p2p method using ddim inversion (original paper).

## Requirements 

```
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
This code was tested with python 3.8 and torch 2.0.0. 

## Repository Structure 
```
├── ddm_inversion - folder contains inversions in order to work on real images: ddim inversion as well as ddpm inversion (our method).
├── example_images - folder of input images to be edited
├── imgs - images used in this repository readme.md file
├── prompt_to_prompt - p2p code
├── main_run.py - main python file for real image editing
└── test.yaml - yaml file contains images and prompts to test on
```

A folder named 'results' will be automatically created and all the results will be saved to this folder. We also add a timestamp to the saved images in this folder.

## Algorithm Inputs and Parameters
Method's inputs: 
```
init_img - the path to the input images
source_prompt - a prompt describing the input image
target_prompts - the edit prompt (creates several images if multiple prompts are given)
```
These three inputs are supplied through a YAML file (please use the provided 'test.yaml' file as a reference).

<br>
Method's parameters are:

```
skip - controlling the adherence to the input image
cfg_tar - classifier free guidance strengths
```
These two parameters have default values, as descibed in the paper.

## Usage Example 
```
python3 main_run.py --mode="our_inv" --dataset_yaml="test.yaml" --skip=36 --cfg_tar=15 
python3 main_run.py --mode="p2pinv" --dataset_yaml="test.yaml" --skip=12 --cfg_tar=9 

```
The ```mode``` argument can also be: ```ddim``` or ```p2p```.

In ```our_inv``` and ```p2pinv``` modes we suggest to play around with ```skip``` in the range [0,40] and ```cfg_tar``` in the range [7,18].

**p2pinv and p2p**:
Note that you can play with the cross-and self-attention via ```--xa``` and ```--sa``` arguments. We suggest to set them to (0.6,0.2) and (0.8,0.4) for p2pinv and p2p respectively.

**ddim and p2p**:
```skip``` is overwritten to be 0.

<!-- ## Create Your Own Editing with Our Method
(1) Add your image to /example_images. <br>
(2) Run ``main_run.py --mode="our_inv"``, choose ``skip`` and ``cfg_tar``. <br>

Example:
```
python3 main_run.py --skip=20 --cfg_tar=10 --img_name=gnochi_mirror --cfg_src='a cat is sitting next to a mirror' --cfg_tar='a drawing of a cat sitting next to a mirror'
```  -->

You can edit the test.yaml file to load your image and choose the desired prompts.

<!-- ## Sources 

The DDPM code was adapted from the following [pytorch implementation of DDPM](https://github.com/lucidrains/denoising-diffusion-pytorch). 

The modified CLIP model as well as most of the code in `./text2live_util/` directory was taken from the [official Text2live repository](https://github.com/omerbt/Text2LIVE).  -->
